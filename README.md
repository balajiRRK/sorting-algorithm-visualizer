# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer Application

A program that helps the user visualize the time complexity differences between multiple different sorting algorithms.

## Instructions to run program

Run only on CMD, not Powershell

Command to rebuild project if any code changes were made: `mvn clean install`

Command to run: `java -cp target\sorting-algorithms-visualizer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar;lib\processingcore.jar main.Main`

## Instructions to interact with program:

- Press 'R' to randomize
- Press spacebar to sort
- Use the left and right arrow keys to cycle between different algorithms
- Use the up and down arrow keys to increase or decrease the fps by 5 frames from a range of 5-90
